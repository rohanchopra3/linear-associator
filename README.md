# linear-associator

[![made-with-python](https://img.shields.io/badge/Made%20with-Python-1f425f.svg)](https://www.python.org/) 

This notebook implmenets a linear associator neural network using numpy. This model can use only 3 types of activation functions, 'Relu' , 'sigmoid' and 'linear'.

#### linear_associator.py :- This is implements multi level neural network.
#### test_linear_associator.py :- This is the test script which uses the multi level neural network to test if it is working properly.

#### To run the test case:-
```python
pytest -q test_linear_associator.py 
```
